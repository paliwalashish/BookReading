Summary

This chapter takes you from initial mode to next step of optimizing the draft.
Here we change to a critic mode, to enhance the draft. Wearing a reader's hat helps to understand how the audience might react to it.
We also need to be aware of time management and avoid the urge for ultimate perfection.

When presenting facts, support them with relevant details like reference materials, code snippets and benchmarks. 
It is an important step, to avoid reader with unanswered questions. 
Flow of the article is pivotal, to captivate readers thought process while reading the article.
A simple process is 
- Start of journey with context and front-load with what to expect
- The journey, keep connecting the dots
- towards the conclusion and optionally what to expect next

Prefer to think of this part as bell curve, with center as central theme and ensure
writing remains within a threshold of the topic (including all sections)

At each step, we can take help from AI, targeting unclear bulky sentences.

A good title can go a long way, absolutely avoiding clickbaits. 
In the end, we need to ensure that we are writing for humans.
